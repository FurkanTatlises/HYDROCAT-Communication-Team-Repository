# HYDROCAT-Communication-Team-Repository
* This repository mainly consists of C++ codes used in Teknofest Unmanned Sea Vehicle Competition. 
* These codes are used to filter the LiDAR data(which is in point cloud data), provide commmunications between the ship and remote control center,
  using the controller for manual operation and the backend of the graphical user interface in remote control center.
* We have used Point Cloud Library to filter and visualize LiDAR data.
* We are using STM32 to provide communication between the shipt and remote control center.
